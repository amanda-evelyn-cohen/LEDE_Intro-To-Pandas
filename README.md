# Lede Program Classwork Assignment

This is a classwork assignment for The Lede Program at Columbia's Graduate School of Journalism (https://ledeprogram.com), Summer 2023

## Topic

Intro To Pandas 

## Description

I was given the .csv files 'continent_facts' and 'countries' and worked in a Jupyter Notebook using pandas to create three files to practice a myriad of tasks. The markdowns in my notebook explicitly explain the work I practiced. Here is an overall look at what each .csv file I exported contains: 

*cont_total = a new data column, GDP per capita, by combining two existing columns 
*continent_lifeexpect = calculated the average life expectancy of each continent
*merged_datasets = converted a series into a data frame, merged both the 'continent_facts' & 'countries' datasets together despite the rows having different names for each continent
